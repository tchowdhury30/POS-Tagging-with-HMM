Test Case 1: "bark", "loud"
Transition Probabilities:
    From start: N (0.6), V (0.4)
    From N: V (0.3), Adj (0.7)
    From V: N (0.8), Adj (0.2)
Observation Probabilities:
    For N: "dog" (0.5), "bark" (0.1)
    For V: "bark" (0.6), "loud" (0.2)
    For Adj: "loud" (0.7), "dog" (0.1)
Result: The algorithm correctly identified "bark" as a verb (V) and "loud" as an adjective (Adj), resulting in the sequence "V Adj".

Test Case 2: "dog", "bark"
    Transition Probabilities: Same as Test Case 1.
    Observation Probabilities: Same as Test Case 1.
Result: The algorithm correctly identified "dog" as a noun (N) and "bark" as a verb (V), resulting in the sequence "N V".

The tests were designed to evaluate the system's ability to correctly identify the POS tags of words in different contexts.
In both test cases, the system successfully identified the correct POS tags based on the given probabilities.

In Test Case 1, the system correctly identified "bark" as a verb and "loud" as an adjective.
This is consistent with the observation probabilities, where "bark" has a higher probability of being a verb and "loud"
of being an adjective.

In Test Case 2, the system correctly identified "dog" as a noun and "bark" as a verb. This aligns with the observation
probabilities, where "dog" has a higher probability of being a noun.

There are various examples of correctly tagged and incorrectly tagged words in
my test sentences above. The system's performance is very dependent on the unseen-word
parameter, which significantly impacts the scoring of state transitions
in the HMM. A high penalty for unseen words can lead to incorrect tagging,
especially for sentences with vocabulary not present in the training data.
The system does not seem to handle punctuation or complex
structures like phrasal verbs and possessives accurately.
